**dnsx** is a fast and multi-purpose DNS toolkit allow to run multiple probers using [retryabledns](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/retryabledns) library, that allows you to perform multiple DNS queries of your choice with a list of user supplied resolvers.

dnsx is successor of [dnsprobe](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsprobe) that includes new features, multiple bugs fixes, and tailored for better user experience, few notable flags are `resp` and `resp-only` that allows to control and print the exact information you are looking for.

We also ported DNS wildcard filtering feature to dnsx from [shuffledns](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/shuffledns) as a standalone support.

# Installation Instructions

### From Source

The installation is easy. You can download the pre-built binaries for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx/releases/) page. Extract them using tar, move it to your `$PATH`and you're ready to go.

```sh
Download latest binary from https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx/releases

â–¶ tar -xvf dnsx-linux-amd64.tar
â–¶ mv dnsx-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/dnsx
â–¶ dnsx -h
```

### From Source

**dnsx** requires **go1.15+** to install successfully. Run the following command to get the repo -

```sh
â–¶ GO111MODULE=on go get -v github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx/cmd/dnsx
```

### From Github

### Install via brew

If you're macOS user and using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can install via `brew` command:

```sh
$ brew install dnsx
```

### Running dnsx

**dnsx** can be used to filter dead records from the list of passive subdomains obtained from various sources, for example:-

```sh
â–¶ subfinder -silent -d hackerone.com | dnsx

      _             __  __
   __| | _ __   ___ \ \/ /
  / _' || '_ \ / __| \  /
 | (_| || | | |\__ \ /  \

**dnsx** can be used to extract **A** records for the given list of subdomains, for example:-

```sh
â–¶ subfinder -silent -d hackerone.com | dnsx -silent -a -resp

a.ns.hackerone.com [162.159.0.31]

support.hackerone.com [104.16.53.111]
```

**dnsx** can be used to extract **CNAME** records for the given list of subdomains, for example:-

```sh
â–¶ subfinder -silent -d hackerone.com | dnsx -silent -cname -resp

support.hackerone.com [hackerone.zendesk.com]
resources.hackerone.com [read.uberflip.com]

mta-sts.forwarding.hackerone.com [hacker0x01.github.io]
events.hackerone.com [whitelabel.bigmarker.com]
```

**dnsx** can be used to extract subdomains from given network range using `PTR` query, for example:-

```sh
mapcidr -cidr 173.0.84.0/24 -silent | dnsx -silent -resp-only -ptr

cors.api.paypal.com
trinityadminauth.paypal.com
cld-edge-origin-api.paypal.com
appmanagement.paypal.com
svcs.paypal.com
trinitypie-serv.paypal.com
ppn.paypal.com
pointofsale-new.paypal.com
pointofsale.paypal.com
slc-a-origin-pointofsale.paypal.com
fpdbs.paypal.com
```



### Wildcard filtering

A special feature of **dnsx** is its ability to handle **multi-level DNS based wildcards** and do it so with very less number of DNS requests. Sometimes all the subdomains will resolve which will lead to lots of garbage in the results. The way **dnsx** handles this is it will keep track of how many subdomains point to an IP and if the count of the Subdomains increase beyond a certain small threshold, it will check for wildcard on all the levels of the hosts for that IP iteratively.

```sh
dnsx -l airbnb-subs.txt -wd airbnb.com -o output.txt
```

# ðŸ“‹ Notes

- As default, **dnsx** checks for **A** record.
- As default dnsx uses Google, Cloudflare, Quad9 [resolver](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx/blob/43af78839e237ea8cbafe571df1ab0d6cbe7f445/libs/dnsx/dnsx.go#L31).
- Domain name input is mandatory for wildcard elimination.
- DNS record flag can not be used when using wildcard filtering.

dnsx is made with ðŸ–¤ by the [projectdiscovery](https://projectdiscovery.io) team.
